	<h1>Setting Goals for Your Site</h1>

		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

			<p>I am highly inspired by the <a href="http://www.unlistedcollection.com"><em>Unlisted Collection</em></a> website and a website for design studio, <a href="http://www.middleofnowhere.com.au/"><em>Middle of Nowhere</em></a>.</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size and balance?</h2>

		<h3><a href="http://www.unlistedcollection.com"><em>Unlisted Collection</em></a></h3>

			<p>This grid based design is evident as soon as you land on the page. The top section is clearly in columns which divide the heading and menu items becoming even more apparent when you navigate to another page.</p>
			<p>The consistent placement of the logo establishes a hierarchy through the use of negative space and typography/formatting. The text overlaying the images, while larger lacks negative space, slightly loosing the focus compared to the logo, however still creates intrigue and draws attention. As you navigate away to other pages you notice the typography starts to vary in weight and size which again draws your attention to this hierarchy. </p>
			<p>The colour palette works together throughout the site and helps indicate that you are on a different page, and overall adds to the balance of the website.</p>
			<p>What I think is unique about the site is the call to action. While the "book a room" widget is not prominent when you land on the page, as you read more content and scroll down, you loose the initial focal point of the logo and the new focal point becomes to the call to action, which follows you as you navigate.</p>

		<h3><a href="http://www.middleofnowhere.com.au/"><em>Middle of Nowhere</em></a></h3>

			<p>While this website is quite simple and primarily photography, it still effectively uses web design techniques while also reflecting the design style of the business.</p>
			<p>The website utilises the landscape layout of a monitor and rule of thirds in it's grid design. Due to the limited content, the website is able to effectively use negative space to establishe clear focal points on the page, isolating the logo, body content and photography.</p>
			<p>While the images are significantly larger and information minimal, in my user experience, the strong yellow and simplicity of the logo established a hierarchy and flow, for me it is the focal point, which then draws me to the body content, then onto the photography. However, this is completely subjective and arguable depending on the user.</p>
			<p>The varying size of the images gives the user a subtle navigational cue to scroll right as they look unfinished (if you first don't read the instruction to scroll right in the body). Once you do this the logo becomes 'transparent' constantly re-establishing a focal point through the changing background.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

			<p> These websites have been designed with completely different goals and solutions in mind.<p/>
			<p><a href="http://www.unlistedcollection.com"><em>Unlisted Collection</em></a>, encourages in depth exploration of the content, using a navigation menu, promotional banners and hierarchy. There is also a clear conversion goal for a user to book a room which is prominent on all pages.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.middleofnowhere.com.au/"><em>Middle of Nowhere</em></a>, however is designed to showcase their services and unique style quickly. It has limited copy and relies on the photography to speak for itself. The call to action is not prominent but is consistently there on the page as you scroll.</p>
			<p>Similarly, both websites keep their logo prominent constantly and consistently. They use the negative space to draw your attention to the branding and content which is balanced and flows in their unique ways. Also both sites aren't highly responsive, their branding remains consistent however the content is lost and relies on the user to scroll the page.</p>
