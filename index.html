	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm a Marketing and Branding Specialist, living in Sydney, Australia. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I am in the process of starting a branding agency with two others. We all bring different skills to the table - design, writing and myself in marketing and branding. Our offering will initially be brand development but we would eventually like to incorporate web design, and because of my interest and basic knowledge in this area, I would like to enhance my skills to be able to offer this service in the near future.</p> 

	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day build a successful business working with brands and providing them with creative solutions and unique identities they can apply across all channels.</p>
